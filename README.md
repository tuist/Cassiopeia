# üåå Cassiopeia

A Swift remote CAS client for [swift-build](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-build) that talks HTTP to your caching service.

> Cassiopeia‚Äôs name pays homage to Berlin‚Äîthe city where Tuist was born‚Äîand to the Cassiopeia club that keeps the city dancing. This client aims to do the same for your builds: keep them moving fast.

## üìñ Overview

Cassiopeia packages the primitives that swift-build expects (`CASProtocol`, `ActionCacheProtocol`) and implements them on top of an HTTP contract. Point the client at a remote service (via `COMPILATION_CACHE_REMOTE_SERVICE_PATH`) and it will push/pull objects, query existence, and manage the action cache over the network.

## ‚ú® Features

- Swift-build compliant CAS + action-cache client
- Remote-only implementation that talks to an HTTP service
- Content-based addressing using SHA256 digests
- Minimal configuration: respects `COMPILATION_CACHE_REMOTE_SERVICE_PATH`
- Swift-native API design with async/await

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üìã Prerequisites

- Xcode 15.0 or later
- Swift 5.9 or later
- macOS 14.0 or later (for development)

### üíª Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tuist/Cassiopeia.git
   cd Cassiopeia
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode**
   ```bash
   open Package.swift
   ```

3. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   swift build
   ```

4. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   swift test
   ```

### üì¶ Using as a Dependency

Add Cassiopeia to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/tuist/Cassiopeia.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

Then add it as a dependency to your target:

```swift
.target(
    name: "YourTarget",
    dependencies: ["Cassiopeia"]
)
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The library centres around the `RemoteCAS` actor. It takes care of:

- Encoding `CASObject` payloads and reference lists into JSON
- Sending/receiving HTTP requests to the configured server
- Translating status codes and payloads into Swift errors or values

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the detailed HTTP contract the server is expected to implement. The same contract is also described in the root-level `cassiopeia-openapi.yaml` so you can feed it directly into tooling or server implementations.

> **Note**: When modifying the HTTP implementation, always keep `cassiopeia-openapi.yaml` in sync with the code.

### Quick Usage

#### As a Swift Library

```swift
import Cassiopeia

// Explicit configuration
let remote = Cassiopeia.makeRemoteCAS(
    baseURL: URL(string: "https://cache.example.com/api")!,
    headers: ["Authorization": "Bearer <token>"]
)

// Or derive everything from the environment
// (expects COMPILATION_CACHE_REMOTE_SERVICE_PATH to be set)
let envBacked = try Cassiopeia.makeRemoteCASFromEnvironment()

// Store some bytes
let object = CASObject(string: "hello caches")
let id = try await remote.store(object: object)

// Later, look it up
if let restored = try await remote.load(id: id) {
    print(restored.data.stringValue ?? "")
}
```

#### With swift-build

To use Cassiopeia as a remote CAS plugin with swift-build, configure these build settings:

```bash
# Enable compilation caching with CAS support
COMPILATION_CACHE_ENABLE_CACHING=YES

# Point to the compiled dynamic library
COMPILATION_CACHE_CAS_PLUGIN_PATH=/path/to/libCassiopeia.dylib

# Point to your remote CAS server
COMPILATION_CACHE_REMOTE_SERVICE_PATH=https://cache.example.com/api
```

The plugin will automatically load and use the remote CAS for all build artifact caching.
