# Cassiopeia

A Swift toolkit for building [swift-build](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-build)-compliant Content Addressable Storage (CAS) systems.

## Overview

Cassiopeia is a Swift Package that provides the foundational components and utilities needed to implement Content Addressable Storage systems compatible with swift-build. CAS is a storage methodology where data is identified and retrieved based on its content (typically using cryptographic hashes) rather than its location, enabling efficient deduplication, integrity verification, and distributed storage capabilities.

## Features

- Swift-build compliant CAS implementations
- Content-based addressing using cryptographic hashes
- Efficient storage and retrieval mechanisms
- Built-in deduplication support
- Swift-native API design
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 15.0 or later
- Swift 5.9 or later
- macOS 14.0 or later (for development)

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tuist/Cassiopeia.git
   cd Cassiopeia
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode**
   ```bash
   open Package.swift
   ```

3. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   swift build
   ```

4. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   swift test
   ```

### Using as a Dependency

Add Cassiopeia to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/tuist/Cassiopeia.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

Then add it as a dependency to your target:

```swift
.target(
    name: "YourTarget",
    dependencies: ["Cassiopeia"]
)
```

## Architecture

Cassiopeia provides a modular architecture for building CAS storage systems that are compatible with swift-build requirements. It handles content addressing, storage backend abstraction, and provides utilities for integration with build systems.
